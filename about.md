#About Us

We are young team full of vitality thanks to our herbs and commitment to health.

Our chief technologist Andrey Nikitin, has been a tea and herb master for more than 20 years. He's based in the Siberian eco-village of Chazhaevka, in the valley where our fireweed is collected to hand-craft Ivan Chai.

Our commercial officer Michael Koch leads the marketing and import operation to make sure the freshest Ivan Chai reaches the people it needs to. He's based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, the same country that was the first to introduce tea to Europe.
