# Lemon Balm

## What is lemon balm?

Lemon balm (*Melissa officinalis*) is a lemon-scented herb that comes from the same family as mint. Lemon balm has traditionally been used to improve sleep, mood, and cognitive function, but the potential benefits don’t stop there.

## Frequently asked questions
### How is it useful for my health issues?
Lemon balm has several different actions and is used for a number of health issues. Taking it internally may help reduce anxiety and improve your mood and your mental concentration. When taken together with valerian, it can ease insomnia. It may also relieve stomach spasms associated with nervousness. It can also relieve stomach spasms in chronic non-specific colitis when taken as part of a herbal combination recipe.

### When will it begin to take effect for me?
Approximately 1 month’s treatment with the essen tial oil is required for calming effects on agitation in dementia to be seen. Taken internally with valerian, effects on sleep may be seen after 9 days’ use. Improved memory occurred within 2.5 hours, according to one study; however, it is not known if and when effects are seen in dementia. Melissa cream has been shown to significantly reduce symp toms of herpes simplex within 2 days, when applied four times daily. Orally, 4-8 weeks of use with Melissa extract is required to see significant changes in Alzheimer’s dementia, whereas improved cognitive function is seen after a single dose in healthy people.

### Are there any safety issues?
One study using tablets of lemon balm found that is was well tolerated. Drug interations are possible and this herb should be used cautiously in people wit hypothyroidism.

## Dosage Range

- Fresh herb: 1.5–4.5 g two–three times daily. 
- Infusion: 1.5–4.5 g in 150 mL water. 
- Fluid extract (1:1) (g/mL): 6–12 mL/day. 
- Ointment: 700 mg/g ointment applied four times daily.


## What clinical evidence is there for lemon balm?

### Anxiety (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)
A small, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover trial involving 18 healthy volunteers investigated the effects of lemon balm extract in two different doses. A significant reduction in stress in was seen in the volunteers taking the larger dose; however alertness was also reduced at the higher dose. ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15272110])

A prospective, open-label, 15-day pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a standardised lemon balm extract on 20 participants with mild anxiety disorders. 95% of the participants responded to the treatment. 70% achieved full remission for anxiety, 85% for insomnia, and 70% for both.([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230760/])

The German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices approves the use of lemon balm in the treatment of anxiety and restlessness. ([http://cms.herbalgram.org/expandedE/LemonBalm.html])

### Cognitive function (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)

Lemon balm has been used for centuries to improve cognitive function and encouraging results from a 2002 clinical study confirm that it can influence memory. 

The randomised, double-blind crossover study involving 20 healthy young volunteers found that single doses of lemon balm (Pharmaton, Lugano Switzerland) were able to modulate both mood and cognitive performance in a dose- and time dependent manner [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062586]. In this study, treatment with the lowest dose (300 mg) increased self-rated ‘calmness’ within 1 hour whereas the 600 mg and 900 mg doses produced significant effects on memory task performance, observable at both 2.5 hours and 4 hours after administration. The highest tested dose (900 mg) was found to significantly reduce alertness within 1 hour, suggesting a dose–response effect.

### Alzheimer's disease (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed the effectiveness and safety of lemon balm in 42 patients with moderate Alzheimers over 16 weeks. By week 4, the difference between the placebo and lemon balm was statistically significant. By week 16, the difference was highly significant. By week 8, the difference was significant on the clinical dementia rating scale and also highly signficant by week 16 [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12810768).

In another study, lemon balm essential oil used as aromatherapy and applied twice daily to face and arms under double-blind placebo-controlled condi- tions was found to be a safe and effective treatment for clinically significant agitation in people with severe dementia (Ballard et al 2002). The trial, which involved 71 subjects, found that after 1 month’s treatment, patients were less agitated, less socially withdrawn and spent more time in con- structive activities than those in the placebo group. Quality-of-life ratings also improved.

### Insomnia (collapsible -opening triggers Audience capture event)

In clinical practice, lemon balm is often prescribed in combination with other herbs such as valerian in the treatment of insomnia. As a reflection of this, a randomised, double-blind multicentre study investi gated the effects of a commercial valerian and lemon balm herbal combination (Songha Night) in 98 healthy subjects (Cerny & Schmid 1999). Treatment was administered over a 30-day period and consisted of three tablets taken half an hour before bedtime, providing a total dose of 1–6 g valerian and 1–2 g lemon balm. Herbal treatment was found to significantly improve sleep quality and was well tolerated.

Another randomised, double-blind crossover study found that the same combination of valerian and lemon balm taken over 9 nights was as effective as triazolam in the treatment of insomnia (Dressing et al 1992). The dose used was equivalent to 1.4 g dried valerian and 0.9 g dried lemon balm.

As with all herbal combination studies, it is difficult to determinethe stand alone effect of lemon balm on insomnia.

The German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices approves the use of lemon balm in the treatment of insomnia (Blumenthal et al 2000).
