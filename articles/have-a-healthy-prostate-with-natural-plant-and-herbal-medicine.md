# Have a healthy prostate with natural plant and herbal medicine


If you want **reliable information on prostate health** but don’t know where to begin, this article is going to be your **best evidence-based resource**. Read it thoroughly to get all the information you need to assess your next best step.

I’ll back all claims with the medical and scientific references so you can choose the best way to maintain (or heal) your prostate health with **natural solutions**. The most common prostate issues are:

Enlarged prostate (also known as Benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). Almost 30% of Dutch men will have this condition after 50 years of age ([https://www.prostaat.nl/]).
Prostate cancer. 12,000 men in the Netherlands get diagnosed with prostate cancer annually ([https://www.kanker.nl/kankersoorten/prostaatkanker/wat-is/prostaatkanker]).
High Prostate Specific Antigen values. A PSA value can be an indication of prostate cancer, but is not definitive ([https://www.andros.nl/prostaatkanker/onderzoek-psa-waarde/]).
Preventability
The first question one may ask is: Can you prevent an **enlarged prostate** or **prostate cancer**?

The short and best answer is no. The main factors, age and family history, are out of your control ([www.webmd.com/men/prostate-enlargement-bph/can-i-prevent-bph#1], [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/in-depth/prostate-cancer-prevention/art-20045641]). What you can do is lower your risk, manage symptoms, and keep your prostate healthy as it slowly grows.

PSA values are merely an indication of prostate health, though by themselves are not definitive diagnoses of any particular condition.

## Fireweed

There have been three studies done on human prostate cancer cells that showed evidence that fireweed infusions can significantly reduce the level of ProstatePSA secretion (Denq, 2019,Stolarczyk, 2013a,Stolarczyk, 2013b).

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved fireweed for “relief of lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia” in their final assessment benefit-risk assessment ([https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/final-assessment-report-epilobium-angustifolium-l/epilobium-parviflorum-schreb-herba_en.pdf])

### Fireweed Dosage Recommendation
The therapeutic dose that is continually referenced in the Europeans Medicines Agency’s final assessment is 1.5 - 2.0 grams taken twice daily on an empty stomach ([https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/final-assessment-report-epilobium-angustifolium-l/epilobium-parviflorum-schreb-herba_en.pdf]).

# Pumpkin seeds 
Pumpkin seeds have long been claimed to help manage the symptoms of an enlarged prostate. 

In 2006 pumpkin seeds proved to alleviate the symptoms of an enlarged prostate and at high concentrations to prevent prostate growth in rats ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295857610_Effect_of_Pumpkin_Seed_Cucurbita_pepo_L_Diets_on_Benign_Prostatic_Hyperplasia_BPH_Chemical_and_Morphometric_Evaluation_in_Rats]).

In 2016 a review on all human studies testing pumpkin seeds claimed it to be useful in improving symptoms of an enlarged prostate. ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27377091]).

Several studies in humans found that eating these seeds reduced symptoms associated with BPH ([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejlt.200700105]).

In a one-year study in over 1,400 men with BPH, pumpkin seed consumption reduced symptoms and improved quality of life ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20098586]).

Further research suggests that taking pumpkin seeds or their products as supplements can help treat symptoms of an overactive bladder.

One study in 45 men and women with overactive bladders found that 10 grams of pumpkin seed extract daily improved urinary function ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032845/]).

[SUMMARY Pumpkin seeds improve your symptoms of an enlarged prostate and may prevent it from getting any bigger at high doses. Still, more research is needed.] 
### Pumpkin seed Dosage recommendation

There’s no standard of dosage, just be careful not to eat too much, as the high fiber content may cause gas or constipation.


## Saw palmetto 
One 12-week study in 92 men showed that taking two capsules daily of Prostataplex, a mix of herbal supplements that includes saw palmetto, helped improve urinary tract symptoms associated with enlarged prostate ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18082217]).

Similarly, another study in 85 men over the age of 45 found that treatment with 160 mg of saw palmetto twice daily reduced lower urinary tract symptoms, increased urine flow, and improved overall quality of life after 6 months ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11744467]).

Other human and animal studies indicate that it may be effective at reducing urinary symptoms and inflammation related to BPH as well ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18082217], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11744467], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25683150]).

Yet, some studies don’t associate saw palmetto with a lower risk of prostate cancer and observe that it may be ineffective at decreasing symptoms of BPH ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16467543],[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16965237], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3100666/]).

According to one test-tube study, saw palmetto berry extract was able to decrease the growth of prostate cancer cells ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11913955]).

Another test-tube study showed that saw palmetto blocked the spread and growth of prostate cancer cells by deactivating specific receptors involved in cancer development ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17671686]).



Further high-quality research is needed to evaluate how saw palmetto may affect prostate health in humans.


[SUMMARY
Saw palmetto may improve urinary tract function and could aid in the treatment of urinary tract symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate. Test-tube studies show that saw palmetto may help decrease the growth of prostate cancer cells. Still, more research is needed.]


### Saw Palmetto Dosage Recommendation
Saw palmetto is widely available in supplement form, making it incredibly easy to add to your daily routine.

It comes in capsule, softgel, and tablet form and is often combined with other ingredients that help enhance prostate health, such as pumpkin seed extract.

Less commonly, it can also be found in ground, dried, liquid extract, or powdered tea form.

Most research is conducted using saw palmetto in dosages of 320 mg per day, often divided into two doses.

Some recommend taking the supplements with food, which can help minimize digestive issues and prevent adverse side effects.
