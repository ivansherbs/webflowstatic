# Proven Effectiveness and Evidence

Ivan Chai is made from the fermented leaves of fireweed (*Epilobium angustifolium*). Read below the proven effectiveness of this plant species.

## Urinary tract and prostate health
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved fireweed for “**relief of lower urinary tract symptoms** related to benign prostatic hyperplasia” in their final assessment of Epilobium angustifolium [1].

There have been three studies done on human prostate cancer cells that showed evidence that fireweed infusions can significantly **reduce the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) secretion** ([2,3,4). A compound in fireweed was shown to powerfully inhibit prostate cell reproduction (3, 6, 7).

Other speicies of Epilobium were used to treat prostatitis and urinary tract symptoms in Europe after Austrian herbalist Maria Trebens published her success in using Epilobium herbal tea treatment in the 1970s and 1980s (1). Modern research has shown why fireweed can treat prostatitis (5).

## Sleep, Excitability, and Anxiety

Ivan Chai is caffeine free. It helps you get to sleep and overcome sleep disorders. It’s a known mild sedative in folk medicine [10,9]. Science does not yet know exactly how it aids in sleep disorders [4,9]. 

## Inflammation

It has been well studied in academia to determine that fireweed is a powerful anti-inflammatory [9,7,1,4]. It has been proven to be more effective than cortisone in suppressing inflammation [6]. 

## Digestive System

Ulcers, gastritis, and colitis can all be remedied by drinking Ivan Chai [6,4]. It helps prevent inflammation of the stomach lining, as well as the smaller and larger intestine. It serves to stabilise digestive imbalances for those with irritable bowel syndrome or undergoing changes in their diet. The Woodlands Cree people had learned that intestinal parasites could be eliminated by drinking a decoction made from the entire fireweed plant [6]. 

# Preparation
To prepare a fireweed infusion, brew 2 g (1 teaspoon) in 1 cup (250 mL) of boiling water (70°C or higher) for 5-8 minutes and then strain.

Tastes similar to black tea, but more earthy and naturally sweet. Does not become bitter if left to brew too long.

# Dosage and course of treatment
Drink 1 cup before meals 2 times daily for at least 10 days.

For a chronic health issue drink 1 cup before meals 3 times daily.

If your health issues have been remedied, you can stop taking fireweed on a regular basis. Restart treatment if symptoms reappear.

This therapeutic dose is continually referenced in the Europeans Medicines Agency’s final assessment (1).


# Safety, contraindications and warnings
Fireweed is an extremely safe herbal infusion. It can be taken as a herbal infusion in excessive amounts and is safe for children.

It’s naturally free of caffeine, uric acid, oxalic acid, and L-theanine.

# Pregnancy and breastfeeding 

Not enough is known about the use of fireweed during pregnancy and breast-feeding. It is recommended to avoid use.

It's always advised to consult your health professional and do your own research before starting any treatment to avoid interactions.

The EMA has claimed that ‘due to the widespread traditional medicinal use for more than 30 years the safety of Epilobium angustifolium… can be assumed' (1).

# Cultural History of Fireweed as Ivan Chai

In the 16th century, Russian monks were forbidden to drink coffee or tea because caffeine was believed by the Russian federal government to cause "intoxication". The monks, seeking alternative beverages, harvested herbs from wild fields and produced their own herbal infusions. The monks noticed that fireweed produced a fragrant floral infusion that had a noticeable effect on their mental state and overall health. The herbal infusion soon became immensely popular with Russians and Europeans alike.

The term "Ivan Chai" was given to the herbal infusion by the foreigners who still enjoyed it in England and other European countries. Its popularity in England grew so drastically that by the end of the 19th century it was most likely noticed as a small threat to the Dutch East India Company. Rumours were supposedly spread that the Russians were poisoning Ivan Chai with white clay.

In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, commercial production ceased and the consumption of Ivan Chai had practically fell to zero for Russia and the rest of Europe. Even in Russia, this beneficial herbal infusion remains somewhat unknown and is slowly making a revival.
