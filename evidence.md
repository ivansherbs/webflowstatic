Proven Effectiveness and Evidence
Ivan Chai is made from the fermented leaves of fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium).

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved fireweed for “relief of lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia” in their final assessment of Epilobium angustifolium (1).

There have been three studies done on human prostate cancer cells that showed evidence that fireweed infusions can significantly reduce the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) secretion (2, 3, 4).

Other speicies of Epilobium were used to treat prostatitis in Europe after Austrian herbalist Maria Trebens published her success in using Epilobium herbal tea treatment in the 1970s and 1980s (1). Modern research has shown why fireweed can treat prostatitis (5).

A compound in fireweed was shown to powerfully inhibit prostate cell reproduction (3, 6, 7).

Tastes similar to black tea, but more earthy and naturally sweet. Does not become bitter if left to brew too long.

For a chronic health issue drink 1 cup before meals 3 times daily.

If your health issues have been remedied, you can stop taking fireweed on a regular basis. Restart treatment if symptoms reappear.

Cultural History of Fireweed as Ivan Chai
In the 16th century, Russian monks were forbidden to drink coffee or tea because caffeine was believed by the Russian federal government to cause "intoxication". The monks, seeking alternative beverages, harvested herbs from wild fields and produced their own herbal infusions. The monks noticed that fireweed produced a fragrant floral infusion that had a noticeable effect on their mental state and overall health. The herbal infusion soon became immensely popular with Russians and Europeans alike.

The term "Ivan Chai" was given to the herbal infusion by the foreigners who still enjoyed it in England and other European countries. Its popularity in England grew so drastically that by the end of the 19th century it was most likely noticed as a small threat to the Dutch East India Company. Rumours were supposedly spread that the Russians were poisoning Ivan Chai with white clay.

In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, commercial production ceased and the consumption of Ivan Chai had practically fell to zero for Russia and the rest of Europe. Even in Russia, this beneficial herbal infusion remains somewhat unknown and is slowly making a revival.
